  Benefits of Using Short Stories to Language Teaching
     Short fiction is a supreme resource for observing not only language but life itself. In short fiction, characters act out all the real and symbolic acts people carry out in daily lives, and do so in a variety of registers and tones. The world of short fiction both mirrors and illuminates human lives.
     The inclusion of short fiction in the ESL / EFL curriculum offers the following educational benefits:
makes the students’ reading task easier due to being simple and short when compared with the other literary genres, 
enlarges the advanced level readers’ worldviews about different cultures and different groups of people,
provides more creative, encrypt, challenging texts that require personal exploration supported with prior knowledge for advanced level readers,
motivates learners to read due to being an authentic material,
offers a world of wonders and a world of mystery, 
gives students the chance to use their creativity,
promote critical thinking skills, 
facilitates teaching a foreign culture (i.e. serves as a valuable instrument in attaining cultural knowledge of the selected community,
makes students feel themselves comfortable and free,
helps students coming from various backgrounds communicate with each other because of its universal language, 
helps students to go beyond the surface meaning and dive into underlying meanings, 
acts as a perfect vehicle to help students understand the positions of themselves as well as the others by transferring these gained knowledge to their own world.
       In brief, the use of a short story seems to be a very helpful technique in today’s foreign language classes. As it is short, it makes the students’ reading task and the teacher’s coverage easier. An important feature of short fiction is its being universal. To put it differently, students all over the world have experienced stories and can relate to them. 
Handout 1.Reading and writing task
                  Short story ‘’The tigress and her mate’’
 Proudfoot, a tiger, became tired of his mate, Sobra, a few weeks after they had set up housekeeping, and he fell to leaving home  earlier and earlier, in the morning, and returning later and later at night. He no longer called her "Sugar Paw", or anything else, but merely clapped his paws when he wanted anything, or, if she was upstairs, whistled. The last long speech he ever made to her at breakfast was "What the hell's the matter with you?  I bring you rice and peas and coconut oil, don't I? Love is something you put away in the attic |with your wedding dress. Forget it." And he finished his coffee, put down the "Jungle News", and started for the door. Where are you going?" Sobra asked. "Out," he said. And after that, every time she asked him where he was going, he said, "Out", or "Away", or "Hush".
    When Sobra became aware of the coming of what would have been, had she belonged to the chosen species, a blessed event,4 and told Proudfoot about it, he snarled, "Growp." He had now learned to talk to his mate in code, and "growp" meant "I hope the cubs grow up to be xylophone players or major generals." Then he went away, as all males do at such a moment, for he did not want to be bothered by his young until the males were old enough to box with and the females old enough to insult. While waiting for the unblessed event to take place, he spent his time fighting water buffaloes5 and riding around with plain-clothes tigers in a prowl car.'1
    When he finally came home, he said to his mate, "Eeps," meaning "I'm going to hit the sack, and if the kids keep me awake by yowling I'll drown them like so many8 common house  kittens." Sobra stalked to the front door of their house, opened I it, and said to her mate, "Scat". The fight that took place was  terrible but brief. Proudfoot led with the wrong paw,8 was j nailed with the swiftest right cross in the jungle, and never I really knew where he was after that. The next morning, when the  cubs, male and female, tumbled eagerly down the stairs demanding to know what they could do, their mother said, "You can I go into the parlour and play with your father. He's the tiger I rug just in front of the fireplace. I hope you'll like him."
      The children loved him.
Moral: Never be mean to a tiger's wife, especially if you are the tiger.
