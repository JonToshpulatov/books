What is HAIKU?
A haiku is traditionally a Japanese poem consisting of three short lines that do not rhyme. A haiku is considered to be more than a type of poem; it is a way of looking at the physical world and seeing something deeper, like the very nature of existence.
This ancient form of poem writing is renowned for its small size as well as the precise punctuation and syllables needed on its three lines. It is of ancient Japanese origin. It contains 17 syllables in 3 lines of five, seven, five. Haiku poems are typically about nature and usually about a specific season.
HAIKU writing techniques are the followings:
What? WHERE?, When?
Juxtaposition
Unfolding
 Zooming

THE BELLES-LETTRES STYLE
Of all the functional styles of language, the most difficult to define is the belles-lettres style. Franz Kafka defines this style as “organised violence done on ordinary speech”. Literary works create their own world. Each is a unique entity. Just as a painter uses paint to create a new image, a writer uses words to create a text. An important thing to recognise about literary works is just how carefully and consciously they are crafted. Words are the raw material of literature and literary writers stretch them to their limits.
D. Crystal said that the literary language is the art in making the unnatural appear natural. For example, a playwright or novelist may write a dialogue which is naturalistic – i. e. it employs colloquialism, dialect words and so on – but this dialogue is very different from spontaneous speech. It will contain no non-fluency features, it will probably be less repetitious and more dramatic than ordinary speech. 
Other forms of literature make no attempt to appear natural – in fact they deliberately surprise the readers´ expectations. They might use familiar words in unfamiliar ways as e. e. Cummings does, or they might coin new words as Gerald Hopkins does. Perhaps we expect poets to use deviant language, but prose writers like James Joyce do it too. The belles-lettres style is a generic term for three sub styles in which the main principles and the most general properties of the style are materialized. These three sub styles are:
the language of poetry
emotive prose
the language of the drama
The belles-lettres style rests on certain indispensable linguistic features which are:
genuine, not trite, imagery, achieved by purely linguistic device
the use of words in contextual and very often in more that one dictionary meaning
a vocabulary which will reflect to a greater or lesser degree the author´s personal evaluation of things or phenomena
a peculiar individual selection of vocabulary and syntax, a kind of lexical and syntactical idiosyncrasy
introduction of the typical features of colloquial language.
The belles-lettres style is individual in essence. Individuality in selecting language means and stylistic devices  is one of its most distinctive properties
So the purpose of the belles-lettres style is to suggest a possible interpretation of the phenomena of life by forcing the reader to see the view point of the writer. ... The belles-lettres style rests on certain indispensable linguistic features which are: genuine, not trite, imagery, achieved by purely linguistic device.
Task 1. Read the story
                        "The Lottery Ticket" by Anton Chekhov
Ivan Dmitrivich is a middle class man who lives with his family. He is well contented as he sits on the sofa reading the paper. His wife is clearing the dishes. She asks her husband to check the lottery numbers. He asks her what is her number. She tells him it is 9499 26. Ivan notices that the first number is indeed 9499. He drops the paper and it falls on his knees. He begins daydreaming about winning the seventy-five thousand. He and his wife both begin daydreaming about what they would do with the money. 
They spend the next few minutes dreaming about a new house and traveling. Both the husband and wife begin making plans for spending the money. 
Both the husband and wife are so excited at the thought of winning all the money. They are smiling and dreaming about what they will do with the money.
Then Ivan begins thinking about the possibility of his wife traveling without him. He begins thinking about her becoming stingy with the money. He begins to hate the idea of her having all that money. Likewise, the wife begins thinking that her husband will be after all her money. After all, it is her money. She begins to hate him for desiring all her money. Before the couple even knows if they have won, they have already spent the money.Finally, the husband looks to see if the number is 26. It is not. It is 46. The couple did not win. Immediately, the husband and wife begin to come back down to earth:
Task 2. After reading the story, try to find a HAIKU related to that text or try to  write a HAIKU by yourself.
For example: 
They are smiling and dreaming about what they will do with the money
“Ivan begins thinking about the possibility of his wife traveling without him,
He begins to hate the idea of her having all that money “.
The wife begins thinking that her husband will be after all her money
She begins to hate him for desiring all her money” .
