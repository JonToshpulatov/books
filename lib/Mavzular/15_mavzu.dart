                                    ’’CARAPACE’’ BY ROMESH GUNESEKERA
The story ‘Carapace’ is a simple story of a Sri Lankan girl whose mother expects her to marry a stranger. The situation is complicated by two factors: she has a boyfriend, who has a very relaxed attitude to what is happening; she doesn’t want to make any decisions. Does she really have a choice anyway? Or is she looking to Vijay to help her make a choice?
     ANURA PERERA IS coming over tonight. Amma - my mother - says I ought to take him seriously. I told Vijay about it. So? He's coming to see me because he is interested in me and he has serious intentions. He lives in Australia! Vijay grinned and said nothing. That's the way with Vijay. Do you know who Anura Perera is? He shook his head, no. Then he laughed, So he's looking for a Lankan wife? Yes! I said. Anura Perera has a dollar job, a Sydney house, and an Australian ticket. So what are you saying? Vijay laughed. You are going to marry this prick with a foreign job? Is that what you've come to tell me? That wasn't what I had come to tell him at  all. I first met Vijay at the new disco. It was a birthday party and there was a crowd of about twenty people in our group. I didn't know many of them. My friend Lakshmi took me along to it. It was her friend's birthday but we had all been waiting to go to this new place. Everyone was talking about it. It was packed out that night. The dance floor was fabulous: round, with lights flashing underneath and all sorts of fantastic gadgets turning around the room. 
     Vijay was not in our party. He came up to me and said, How about a dance? I could hardly hear him, but I could see his mouth in the dark. And when the lights flashed on him I could see him looking straight at me like he really wanted to dance with me. We danced all night. He bought me rum and coke and smoked lots of cigarettes. In the end he asked whether we could meet again. Only the next day I discovered he is the cook at the Beach Hut. 
     He is older than me; tall and long and always smiling. He has such a mop of hair and is so skinny. He never eats! He says he likes to see his food eaten by other people. To watch his customers, his friends, grow fat and happy. He says there is nothing he likes better than to stir his pan of squid in front of the ocean. His face is big and square like a bony box stretched over with skin; his lips barely keep his teeth in and he always seems about to burst into a laugh. And when he does the whole sea seems to crease up. The beach is so lovely with him. When I went to see him today he said hello with a big grin on his face. Come sit down, I won't be long. 
  He had a basin full of enormous prawns on his lap.
 Loku isso, he said.A newspaper spread out on the floor under him was heaped with plucked prawn heads and shells. Orange whiskers. 
After peeling each prawn he carefully pulled out a thin blue vein that curved around it like a backbone. Look at that, he held the vein up: sea-poison. At first I didn't even want to open my mouth about Anura Perera, but Amma says you must always go for the best you can.    And I know Anura Perera will come in a big Mitsubishi, air-conditioned with tinted glass and a stereo. I wanted Vijay to know.
      When he finished with the prawns he washed his hands and poured out some coffee for me. What are we going to do? I asked. I wanted to know what he really felt for me. About what? About us, I said. What are we going to do?      He said, There's an American film at the Majestic .It is so easy for him. He doesn't see anything. There are no problems, no hang ups. He's not like the other guys around here, always trying something on. He comes straight out with what he thinks. But I must have looked worried; he leaned forward. What is it you want to know then? he asked, touching my hand.
     He has such a light touch. His fingernails are like sea-shells, slightly pink, with little half-moons peeping out. When he touches my hand with his fingers I feel tremendous and I want to go on like this for ever, just drinking coffee together and looking at the sea.
     I told him we've got to sort things out. Going to the pictures won't solve anything. But you like movies, he said. For months nothing has happened and now   suddenly everything happens: Vijay first, now Anura Perera. When Amma talks to me I see a whole new world. I don't think Vijay could even imagine it. He would just laugh.
     Amma said we could go and buy a new saree. Something really nice. And I saw just the shoes at Tonio's, next to the supermarket. Imagine flying, stopping in Singapore! I can't believe it but it is what I've dreamed of all along; something happening so I can be someone instead of this crazy feeling that nothing matters. But then when I go to Vijay I really don't know what I want. . .He looked at me and clicked his tongue, So what matters so much? He lit one of his thin crackly cigarettes and stretched out on his chair. His head rested on the back of it; he let his mouth stay open like a fish gulping. Sometimes he can be so idiotic! But it isn't that simple. It isn't! We can't just stay like this, I said. The Beach Hut isn't going to me here forever. The bamboo and coconut will split. The wood on the window-frame is already rising, turning itself inside out. I looked out of the doorway and watched the green sandy water of the ocean swelling and falling. You can't be a beach cook for the rest of your life, I said. Or is that all you want? Do you really only want to be a cook all your life? I didn't want to upset him, I just wanted him to say something; but he just stared at me. He looked at me as if I were way out at sea, already floating across the ocean. 
     But who is the drifter? Not me. A crowd of bathers turned up looking for beer and his beach roti, so I said I better go; he had work to do. I asked him to call me as soon as he could, before evening. It is important. Call me, please. He smiled sweetly and nodded OK. Then he screwed up his eyes and sucked the last of his smoke through his fingers and held it in his chest. At home everyone was busy. I came to my room and stayed out of the way. I wanted to be alone. Nobody seemed to miss me. By five o'clock, when I looked out, the whole place was dusted and tidied up; the floor in the front room has been polished and Auntie Manel has even brought flowers for that ghastly green vase that sits by the telephone. The house is filled with a kind of sea musk. 
     Amma has made sandwiches and patties and roasted cashew nuts spiced with red chilly to put out in her special silver bowl. I have never seen the place looking like this.
     Amma has been having palpitations; I know she has been rushing around all over the place arranging everything, her breasts heaving with excitement. She is so anxious, but it's no accident that this first meeting is happening tonight; she would have consulted her astrologer. She wouldn't have taken any risks! It must be the most auspicious day of the month. I suppose I should make a fuss and ask her: Do I have a choice in all of this? But I don't want to choose. I hate choosing. It's all so crazy. What's in Australia anyway? Everyone wants to go there, especially when there's any disturbance here. But what for? 
     I like the beach here. I like our road, our bougainvilleas slumping over the wall and that sandy walk we go on across the railway tracks down to the sea. I like the disco. I like going by putt-putt yellow three wheelers. Just to live in a large fancy bungalow with a view of the Opera House or something! What's so great about that? Vijay would say it's all in the head.If only he would turn up with something. 
    But Amma would die if she knew about him. She'd throw a fit. A cook on the beach! What she wants to say is . . . Good evening Mr Perera, so pleased to meet you. Do come and take my daughter away; transform her world with your brilliance -and your nice fat bank account. Give her a modern house, a big car, fancy clothes, shoes she can afford to throwaway after every party. Give her expensive things, and by-the-by your unswerving respect, and all will be well. She will be an asset to your career, a pearl in your crown. Just take her Mr Perera, please take her to Australia away from here, and don't forget her mother.

Activity 3. Case study
The following is a brief description of arranged marriages in Japan. After you have read it, solve the problem  ‘Does “arranged marriage” matter?’. Use case study for giving ideas to 5 points.
                                Arranged Marriages
      In Japan, there are two types of marriage: the so-called love marriage and the arranged marriage. The love marriage is the type we are familiar with in the West, where the couple meet independently without the assistance of a go-between or matchmaker. Although the arranged marriage was predominant in the past, the majority of Japanese marriages today are love marriages. Estimates vary, placing the proportion of arranged marriages at anywhere from 25 to 50 percent. 
    When a young woman reaches marriageable age (now about 25 for a Japanese woman), she and her parents compile a packet of information about her, including a photograph of her in kimono and descriptions of her family background, education, hobbies, accomplishments, and interests. Her parents then inquire among their friends and acquaintances to see if anyone knows a man who would be a suitable husband for her. 
    The person who does becomes the go-between, showing the packet to the potential bridegroom and, if both parties are interested, arranging a meeting between them. (The man provides a photograph and information as well.) 
   Such meetings often take place in the restaurant of an expensive hotel. The go-between is present, usually along with representatives from both families. If the young couple feel inclined, they will begin dating, with marriage as a possible – but not inevitable - result. It is not uncommon for a woman to have 10 or more such introductions before she finds the man she wants to marry.
      The young man and woman make the final decision about marriage between themselves, though they seek the advice and approval of their parents and their go between. Some Japanese feel that romantic love is not the most important ingredient in a successful marriage; perhaps this belief is borne out by the fact that the divorce rate in Japan generally is lower than that in many countries in Europe. The divorce rate for arranged marriages in Japan is lower than for love marriages.
                             Does “arranged marriage” matter?
1. It assumes that a man/woman capable of voting, drinking, driving, working in a professional environment etc. etc. is incapable of finding a lifelong companion for himself/herself.
2. Since “arranged marriages” are usually, if not always “arranged” by the families of the people getting married, it follows that the “criteria” for a “match” are significantly different than what individuals would apply.
     For instance while I would look for attributes like compassion, intelligence, wit, tolerance(for me!),love, career, physical chemistry and mental-connect(not necessarily in that order) in a potential wife, my parents would probably look for attributes like family, career, respect for elders, ability/willingness to adjust etc. in a potential daughter-in-law. Although not wrong per sent, it brings together individuals who might not have liked each other had they met in normal life. Something about that strikes me as very artificial.
3. It assumes that marriage is something that needs to be done with at a particular time of our lives (hence the family pressures from the time you hit your mid-twenties), instead of leaving individuals free to mould their lives to the way they want and marry when they feel the “need” for it.
4. It is one of the primary carriers of social inequality in modern India even today. Marrying into the same caste, giving/taking “gifts”(or dowry as it more popularly known!), evaluating women and men using different criteria and the devastating amounts of money that are spent on organizing “lavish” weddings by even poor people are just some of the reasons why I say this.
5. Instead of falling in love and then getting deciding to be together for the rest of their lives, “arranged marriages” are based on the notion that you decide on being together for the rest of your lives first, and then fall in love. Although falling in love is not a necessary condition for remaining married. 
   That is plain stupid! I’ll use what I call the “Lawn-mower Argument” to prove this: instead of
