1. Text stylistics
2. Functional stylistics
 Key words:  text types, functional styles; compositional structure of the text;
stylistic text categories; stylistic means of cohesion and coherence.
 There are close links between Stylistics and Text Linguistics. It is due to the fact that stylistics tor the most part is based on the study of texts, mainly literary texts. Therefore it is expedient to single out a stylistic trend (Text Stylistics) in text linguistics, which embraces a great variety of problems:
text types related to the problem of functional styles;
 compositional structure of the text;
stylistic text categories;
stylistic means of cohesion and coherence;
Let us briefly elucidate some of these problems. Functional Stylistics, as is well-known, is concerned with the description of various types of texts. In Text Linguistics the problem of text types is also in the focus of interest, and it is studied in text typology and text stylistics. One o f the main tasks of Text Stylistics is to study language means functioning in typified standard situations. 
     Therefore much attention is attached to the text types characterized by definite stylistic functions and traits. Besides, the stylistic theory of Text Linguistics is faced with the problem of compositional speech forms, to wit: narration, description, reasoning, dialogue (monologue, polylogue). All these forms will be extensively discussed further. Here it is worth mentioning that according to a text type either this or that compositional form prevails. Thus the dramatic text is presented in the form of a dialogue. 
   The scientific text is based on reasoning. As for the publicistic text, it is mainly narration. A peculiar feature of the fictional text is the combination of all the above mentioned forms, each fulfilling its own communicative-aesthetic function.
      Text Stylistics also deals with the problem of the compositional structure of the text. Composition is a complex organization o f the text, the elements o f which are arranged according to a definite system and in a special succession. It implies not only certain correlations of stylistic layers within the text, but also definite schemes of text development.
 On the one hand composition is closely connected with the semantic structure of the text, on the other - with the type of the text. In fact it serves as one o f criteria in the definition of a text type.
     Thus, the compositional structure of a fable is: exposition — dialogue - action - moral. The compositional scheme of a story is: title - exposition - initial collision — development  of action - culmination - denouement - end. As for a sonnet, its composition consists of 2 parts including 14 lines. The first part contains exposition and the main theme. The second part presents denouement. A concluding line o f the sonnet is considered to be most significant from the point of view of both stylistic and conceptual information. The compositional structure of an application is quite different. It includes: heading, which contains the name of an applicant, his address, and the date; a brief essence of the application; the text itself which contains a request and its grounds; concluding phrases and signature.
      So, the above described compositional schemes supply sufficient evidence to the fact that the compositional structure depends on a text type, and this assumption once more confirms the idea of close links between stylistics and text linguistics.
      The core role in text stylistics is certainly attached to stylistic categories. This problem requires a special attention and will be discussed in other sections. Here it is necessary to stress that many traditional stylistic categories and notions applied to text stylistics should be reviewed and reconsidered. For instance, such categories as imagery, implicitness, emotiveness, evaluation are regarded not as properties ascribed to separate language units, but mostly as text phenomena.
Another issue relevant to Text Stylistics is stylistic cohesion o f the text. 
      Among all others, the means of stylistic cohesion play a considerable, sometimes predominant role. There is a great variety o f stylistic means of cohesion: parallel constructions, all types o f repetition, sustained stylistic devices, symbols and so on. It is to be noted that stylistic means of cohesion are characterized by simultaneous realization of two functions: stylistic and text-forming. We have already discussed the role of recurrence in this respect. Recent researches have shown that recurrence, traditionally studied as a stylistic means, is considered a basic factor in the structural and semantic organization o f the text, and what is more, it is regarded as a fundamental principle of text integrity. 
      The significance 0f recurrence is confirmed by the facts that a) it is round practically in all languages; b) it is realized at all the language levels from a phoneme up to the whole text; c) it designates a thematic development o f the text; d) it fulfills various stylistic and pragmatic functions. The following rhyme may serve as an illustration:
For want o f a nail, the shoe was lost,
For want o f the shoe, the horse was lost,
For want o f the horse, the rider was lost
For want o f the rider, the battle was lost
For want o f the battle, the kingdom was lost
And all from the want o f a horseshoe nail.
     This example is interesting in many respects. First of all it demonstrates all types o f repetition - anaphora, epiphora, chainrepetiti0Ili framing, and anadiplosis. Then it promotes the thematic development of the text. And finally, it is a mechanism of shaping text as such.   
      Developing the topic o f stylistic cohesion we cannot help mentioning the role o f stylistic devices, especially symbol. As is known, symbol is a trope functioning in the literary texts as a polyconceptual structure, and assuming various stylistic functions. At the same time, it is necessary to underline its text-forming function because symbolic meanings appear in the text on the basis of frequently repeated key notions. Here are some examples;
Rain — a symbol o f unhappiness, loneliness and sufferings in the works by E.Hemingway;
Sandcastle - a symbol o f illusive love and unreal dreams (A.Murdock);
Oak tree - a symbol o f powerful England (J. Galsworthy);
  Functional stylistics
    Functional Stylistics deals with the problems of functional styles, their stylistic regularities, spheres of communication and communicative aims. Before proceeding with the topic of functional styles, some remarks on the notion o f functions, their types and classification are to be made. There are different approaches to the problem o f language functions concerning both their qualitative and quantative characteristics. Most known is the theory o f language functions suggested by R. Jackobson. The scholar differentiated six functions in accordance with the communicative factors o f any speech event:
the emotive function - “a direct expression of the speaker’s attitude toward what he is speaking about”. This function is of paramount significance for the literary text;
the emphatic function - the function of establishing contacts between the communicants. This function is relevant to the oral communication, the colloquial style;
the conatative function is oriented toward the addressee with the intention to influence, persuade, exhort him. In terms of modem linguistics this function is akin to the pragmatic function aimed to exert an influence on the addressee;
the referential (denotative, cognitive) function - the reflection o f some fragments of the world; and it has crucial relevance to all text types;
the poetic function has to do with the linguistic form of a verbal sign and its significance. This function appears to be pivotal in the literary text.
    At  present it has been acknowledged that there are two basic functions o f language: communicative assigned to realize a communicative event, and cognitive aimed to transfer knowledge structures. Both functions can be realized in a variety o f more concrete and specific functions: informative, social, emotive, stylistic, pragmatic, aesthetic, etc.
      Passing over to the problem of functional styles, it should be stressed that each functional style serves a definite aim in communication fulfilling specific functions. A functional style is defined as a system of language means characterized by the greater or less typical for its constituents, the choice and arrangement of interdependent and interwoven language media used to secure the purport of the communication. In other words, a functional style is regarded as a product o f a certain concrete communicative task set by the sender of the message. The correlation between communicative aim and functional styles can be presented as follows:
Belles-lettres style — to produce an aesthetic influence on the reader (listener);
Publicistic style — to exert a constant and deep influence on the public opinion and to cause the reader (listener) to accept the point of view expressed in the text;
Newspaper style — to inform and influence the public opinion on political and other matters;
Scientific style  — to prove a hypothesis, to create new concepts; 
   The style of official documents — to reach agreement between two contracting parties.
There is a diversity of opinions as far as the taxonomy of functional styles is concerned. I.V. Arnold distinguishes six functional styles: colloquial, oratorical, poetic, publicistic and newspaper, official, scientific.
I.R. Galperin differentiates 5 functional styles giving the detailed hierarchy of their substyles:
the belles-lettres functional style with the sub-styles of: a) poetry; b) emotive prose; c) drama;
the publicistic functional style with the sub-styles of: a) oratory; b) essays; c) feature articles in newspapers and journals;
the newspaper functional style with the substyles of: a) brief news items; b) newspaper headings; notices and advertisements;
the scientific functional style with the sub-style of: a) humanitarian sciences; b) exact sciences; c) popular scientific prose;
The official document functional style with the sub-styles of: a) diplomatic documents; b) business documents; c) legal documents; d) military documents.
      I.R. Galperin argues that functional styles are patterns of only the written variety o f language, whereas other scholars insist on the existence of a colloquial style . According to I.V. Arnold the colloquial style exists in two varieties: literary- colloquial and familiar-colloquial. This style is mainly based on the oral type of speech, but in some case it can be presented in the written form. For example, dialogues and monologues in the literary text, personal correspondence, advertisements. 
 This style is characterized by a set of peculiar features: by all forms of:
1) compression (it’s, don’t, we’ve been travelling all the winter? Morning!); 
2) redundancy (in contrast to the previous one), created by “time fellers” (well, I mean, you see), double negation (don’t give me no reddles), all types of repetitions, intensifiers (actually, really, sure), questions- exclamations (Who can blame anyone!), emphatic structure (the war does spoil everything); 
3) colloquialisms: slang, vulgar words, jargonisms.
    Most interesting for the aims of our manual is the belles-lettres style characterized by a system of peculiar features which make up the foundation of this style. First and foremost it is an aesthetic function o f the literary text reflected in its ability to describe an imaginary world of the author, his conceptual world picture and call forth the lyrical feelings o f the reader, the emotions of pleasure derived from the form and content o f a literary work. 
      From the linguistic point of view the belles-lettres text is characterized by emotiveness, imagery, implicitness and expressiveness created by expressive means o f the language and stylistic devices, by the use of words in contextual meanings, by the vocabulary reflecting the author’s personal evaluation of things and phenomena.
