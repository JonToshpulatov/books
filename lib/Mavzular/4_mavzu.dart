Each of these substyles has certain common features, typical of the general belles-lettres style. Each of them also enjoys some individuality. The purpose of the belles-lettres style, like unlike scientific, is not to prove but only to suggest a possible interpretation of the phenomena of life by forcing the reader to see the viewpoint of the writer.
The belles-lettres style has certain linguistic features:
Genuine, not trite, imagery, achieved by linguistic devices.
The use of words in contextual and very often in more than one dictionary meanings.
A vocabulary which will reflect to a greater or lesser degree the author’s personal evaluation of things or phenomena.
A peculiar individual selection of vocabulary and syntax.
The introduction of the typical features of a colloquial language to a full degree (in plays) or lesser one (in emotive prose) or a slight degree (in poems).
The usage of some stylistic devices in belles-lettres style is more obvious then other styles. For instance if we take the metaphorical structure of emotions in the romantic novels we should pay attention to the lists of metaphors, the majority of metaphors emphasize the sense of emotions and feelings of human body. Certainly they can occur in literal books as novel, poems, stories. 
The usage of some stylistic devices in belles-lettres style
The usage of some stylistic devices in belle-lettres style is more obvious then other styles. For instance, if we take the metaphorical structure of emotions in the romantic novels we should pay attention to the lists of metaphors, the majority of metaphors emphasize the sense of emotions and feelings of human body. Certainly they can occur in literal books as novel, poems, stories. For foreign language students stylistic analysis holds particular difficulties: linguistic intuition of a native speaker, which is very helpful in all philological activities, does not work in the case of foreign learners. Besides, difficulties may arise because of the inadequate language command and the ensuing gaps in grasping the basic, denotational information. Starting stylistic analysis, thus one should bear in mind that the understanding of each separate component of the message is an indispensable condition of satisfactory work with the message as a whole, of getting down to the core and essence of its meaning.
Stylistic analysis not only broadens the theoretical horizons of a language learner but also teaches the latter the skill of a competent reading, on the one hand, and proprieties of situational language usage, on the other.	Each style of literary language makes use of a group of language means the interrelation of which is peculiar to the given style. Each style can be recognized by one or more leading features. For instance the usage of special terminology is a lexical characteristic of the style of scientific prose.
There are several source domains that appear very often. Expressions are used to give effect to a statement. Imagine how bland a statement such as “he was sad” is, compared to a statement describing a “sea of grief.” The latter statement is much more influential and effective. The metaphor is sure to give the reader a better idea of the depths of grief in this situation. When we want to effect on somebody`s emotions it is better to use those metaphoric expressions. Similarly, who would really spend time thinking of the vast differences between success and failure if the metaphor was missing, and the statement was just “Everyone wants to be successful, no one wants to be a failure?” That statement would be a failure itself, in inspiring interest in the conversation!
Metaphors are meant to create an impact in the minds of readers. The aim of this literary tool is to convey a thought more forcefully than a plain statement would. If the narrator or writer do not use any kind of metaphor or stylistic devices his literary work become ‘dry’. The exaggeration plays an important role in process of metaphors, they add or manifold the meaning, it may decrease the depth of meaning. Metaphor may express distinctions or implicit comparisons between categories without explicitly identifying the comparison. For example, "She swept through the room" subtly categorizes the manner of moving without explicitly mentioning crawling, marching, sneaking or just simply walking.
Metaphor is not merely an artificial device making discourse more vivid and poetical. It is also necessary for the apprehension and communication of new ideas. It is the way in which creative minds perceive things. 
Examples of genuine metaphors which are used in Belles letters style: the lips were tight little traps; the whole space was a  bowl of  heat; this virus carried a gun; the dark swallowed him; Mrs. Small’s eyes boiled with excitement; the words seemed to dance….
Examples of trite metaphors: The salt of life; a flight of imagination; the ladder of fame; to burn with passion (anger). The following metaphors enriched English phraseology: foot of a bed, leg of a chair, head of a nail, to be in the same  boat, blind window.
The main function of the metaphor is to create images. Genuine metaphors create bright images in poetry and emotive prose. Trite metaphors are widely used in newspaper and scientific style. They help the author make the meaning more concrete and brighten his writings as it is an indispensable quality of human thought and perception.
Usage of Metonymy in Belles letters style. As we know, metonymy is a transfer of meaning based upon the association of contiguity (proximity). In metonymy the name of one thing is applied to another with which it has some permanent or temporary connection: He felt as though he must find a sympathetic intelligent ear (Th.Dreiser). the transfer of meanings may be based on temporal, spatial, casual, functional, instrumental and other relations.
Like metaphors metonymy can be divided into trite metonymy ( i.e. words of metonymic origin)and genuine metonymy.
In trite metonymy the transferred meaning is established in the semantic structure of the word as a  secondary meaning. In the course of times its figurativeness and emotional colouring fades away.eg: nickel, the coin of the US and Canada worth 5 cent; hand, a workman; bench, a judge; cradle, the place where something begins (origin); grave, death; house, the people voting after a debate. 
Metonymy may be divided into figures of speech established in the language is frequent in colloquial speech, eg. The whole table was stirring with impatience i.e.the people sitting round the table were impatient. Green fingers, people who have skill for growing gardens; blue-collars, workers in factories, who wear overalls contrasted with white-collar workers, a symbol of non-manual labour.
Metonymy is based on different relations of contiguity (proximity): 
1) a leading significant feature of a person can be  used instead of its possessor: who is the  moustache? (Who is the man?) Olive uniforms (young men) ; cotton prints(women) (J.Steinbeck). Some names in fairy-tales: Red Riding Hood, Bluebeard, who marries and kills one wife after another;
2) a symbol can be used for an object: then I think of taking silk (to become a lawyer) (Ch. Snow);
3) the name of the place can be used for somebody or something connected with it ; it was too late for the river (a picnic on the riverside) (J.Galsworthy);
4) a concrete noun may stand for an abstract one: My mother’s voice had the true tiger in it (J.Updike) (had fierce in it);
5) an abstract notion may stand for a concrete one: Subservience sprang round the counter (A.Bennett) (weak and mild people were standing round the counter); 
6) an object may denote an action: when I awakened old sleepy Mary was up and gone … and coffee and bacon were afoot (the breakfast was ready).
A metonymy differs from a metaphor by the fact that a metaphor may be periphrased into  a simile by the help of such words as : AS, IF, so as, like etc. with metonymy you cannot do so.
The sources where images for metonymy are borrowed are quite different: features of a person, an object, facial appearance, names of writers and poets, names of their books, names of 
Synecdoche is the case when the part of an object is called instead of the whole object. It has given rise to many phraseological units: under one’s roof (in one’s house); not to lift a foot (do not help, when help is needed);
The function of metonymy are different.The general  function  of metonymy is building up imagery and it mainly deals with generalization of concrete objects. Hence nouns  in metonymy are mostly  used with the definite article, or without it at all 
Irony is considered as the stylistic device which gives certain emotions in Belles letters style and irony is also based on the realization of two logical meanings (dictionary and contextual), which stand in opposition. It is the clash of two diametrically opposite meanings. Eg: the man they had got now was a jolly, light- hearted, thick- headed sort of a chap, with about as much sensitiveness in him (J.K.J.). In this utterance two words “thick- headed” and “sensitiveness” exclude each other. The opposition is based on the interplay between the meanings of these two words: “thick- headed” means a stupid, dull person and “sensitiveness” means a sensitive person who is easily hurt in the spirit, easily offended. 
Sometimes irony in Belles letters style is mixed up with sarcasm/ sarcasm is a bitter or wounding remark, taunt, especially ironically worded. Usually socially aimed irony is also called sarcasm: once upon a time in a sceptered island ruled a Great White Queen and enchantress…
In fact the majority of people did not have to work at all, only the rich, were punished , left with the worries that money brings(from morning Star).
In this text the author gives a sarcastic description of the former prime Minister of Great Britain- V.Thatcher. sarcasm appears due to the use of contradictory notionsa Queen and enchantress disallow anything that was not good for them; only rich people had  to work; rich people were punished ; rich people were left with  worries etc. sarcasm is kept whole due to the use of such devices as periphrasis: “ a sceptered island” instead of great Britain; litotes- disallowing anything that was not good for them ; epithets- a sceptered island, a stern and loving hand. 
Irony largely depends on the environment. We ought to distinguish between irony and humour. Humour causes laughter. But the function of irony is not to produce a humorous effect only. In some cases it can express a feeling of irritation, displeasure, pity or regret. Richarrd Altick says “the effect of irony lies in the striking disparity between what is said and was is meant”. 
The function of irony is to convey a negative meaning. Usually only positive concepts are used to convey a negative meaning.
Besides the relations of two meanings, irony may be based on the opposition between two style levels. Elements of poetic diction or elevated vocabulary acquire the stylistic function of irony when used in colloquial speech.
As we know, the emotive meaning of a word can be clearly understood if we introduce the notion of neutral meaning. It denotes the unemotional communication. Stylistic significance of emotional words and constructions are easily sensed when they are set against the non emotional words and constructions.
Usage of Interjections in Belles letters style. Usually these words express our feeling such as regret, despair, sorrow, woe, surprise, astonishment etc. in the previous parts we have spoken about interjections which were defined as expressive means of the language.  Emotionally coloured features of interjections after conscious and intentional intensification of their structural and semantic properties move up to a generalized status and become a stylistic device. 
Interjections may be divided into simple and derivative.
Simple interjections : Oh! Ah! Bah! Pooh! Gosh! Hush! Alas!
Derivative interjections: Heavens! Good gracious! Dear me! Good! By the lord! God knows! Bless me! Hum bug!
There are a number of adjectives and adverbs which may be classified as interjections in Belles letters style. Among them are the following: terrible, awful, great, wonderful, splendid. When they are used as  interjections they are not used in their logical dictionary meanings as intensifiers.
Usage of epithets in Belles letters style. The epithet is a SD which is built on the interplay of two meanings of a word: emotive and logical. It denotes a permanent or temporary quality of a person, thing, idea, phenomenon and characterizes it from the point of view of subjective perception: gooseberry eyes, cat-like eyes, proud boxing gloves, iron hate, waiting silence, silver hair, roseberry blond hair. The degree of individual subjective evaluation is clearly seen if we compare these word combinations with the traditional logically founded word combinations: black, green, small, large eyes; light, heavy, good, black boxing gloves, great, long deep silence, black, white, long, grey, short hair.
A comparison of such word combinations as “iron gate” and “iron will” shows the difference between an epithet and a logical attribute. In the first case “iron” is a logical attribute denoting a special type of gates, whereas in “iron will” – iron serves as an epithet and denotes an “ unyielding will”. The same refers to “green meadow”, “green old age”, “ green thoughts”, “steel weapon” and “steel will” etc.
An epithet has always an emotional meaning or connotation. This meaning may be combined with denotational meaning or it may exist independently.
After the long usage epithets form fixed word combinations which are established in the language and enter the group of set expressions: true-love, merry mind, lady gay, sweet smile, heated discussion.
Individual epithets depend on the author’s style and his artistic purpose. Eg: He looked shy and embarrassed and a wild hope came to me (G.Green).
The studio was filled with the rich odor of roses… the heavy scent of the lilac, the delicate perfume of the thorn (I.Murdoch).
Semantic criterion gives us the right single out a feature which is essentially typical, inherent in the concept of the object they describe: the red sunset, the towering woods, dark clouds etc. unassociated epithets characterize the object through a feature which is not typical and alien for this object. Such association immediately brings surprising effect, attracts the reader’s attention. Eg.: elegant books, smiling year, dim roar, the wild moon. These adjectives indicate properties which are associated with other notions: elegant manners, smiling child, dim light (outline, memories etc).
Syntactically an epithet may either precede its head- word or it may follow it. Post-positive epithets may be expressed by a prepositional phrase: leaves of brownish gold. They carried a little feeling of holiday with them.
While speaking about epithets we must distinguish different structural types such as: simple, compound, string, phrase, sentence epithets and reversed epithets. Here are the illustrations: Simple epithets: a brainless animal, a sensible stroke .
