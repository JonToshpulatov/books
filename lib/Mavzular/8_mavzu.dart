1. The literary  styles;
2. The neutral styles;
3. The colloquial style.
Key words: Literary coinages, poetic words, archaic words, barbarisms and foreign words, common colloquial words, slang, jargonisms, professional words.
Handouts 1. Venn diagram
       In accordance with the division of the language into literary and colloquial the whole of the word-stock of the English language may be divided into 3 main layers:
1) the literary (bookish), which is typical of formal styles;
2) the neutral, which is used in different styles;
3) the colloquial, which is typical of lower (colloquial) style :
bookish – offspring, infant
 neutral -child
colloquial - kid
The aspect o f the  neutral  layer is its universal character. This layer is unrestricted in its use. It can be employed in all styles o f languages and in all spheres of human activity.
The  literary  vocabulary consists o f the following groups of words:
1) common literary,
2) terms and learned words,
3) poetic words,
4) archaic (устаревшие) words,
5) barbarisms and foreign words (варваризмы),
6) literary coinages plus nonce-words 
(литературные новообразования и авторские неологизмы).
The  colloquial  vocabulary falls into the following groups:
1) common colloquial words,
2) slang,
3) jargonisms,
4) professional words,
5) dialectal words,
6) vulgar words,
7) colloquial coinages.
     Neutral words are the main source o f synonyms and polysemy and have no special stylistic colouring.Common literary words  are chiefly used in writing and in polished speech. Common literary words stand in opposition to colloquial units. This is apparent when pairs of synonyms, literary and colloquial can be formed which stand in contrasting relation. Cf.:
Colloquial –daddy, get out, go on
 Neutral- father, go away, continue
Literary- parent, retire, proceed
      Both literary and colloquial words have their upper and lower ranges. The lower range of literary words approaches the neutral layer and has a markedly obvious tendency to pass into that layer. The same may be said o f the upper range o f the colloquial layer. It can very easily pass 
into the neutral layer. Terms are the words that are directly relevant to the system or set of terms used in a particular science, discipline, art.
      Terms are mostly used in special works dealing with the notions o f some branch of science.
 When used in the belle-letters style, the terms either indicate the technical peculiarities of the subject or make some reference to the occupation of a character o f the book.
     Poetic and Highly Literary Words form a rather insignificant layer of the special literary vocabulary. They are mostly archaic and very rarely used. Highly literary words aim at producing an elevated effect.
     The main function o f poetic words is to sustain the special elevated atmosphere of poetry: Albion s Isle, to dwell, mirth (fun), to quoth (to speak).
   Obsolete words have already gone completely out o f use but are still recognized by the English-speaking community: eg.  Methinks - it seems to me,  nay - no.
  Archaic words are no longer recognizable in modern English; they have dropped out o f the language entirely or have changed in their appearance so that they have become unrecognizable. Archaic words are frequently used in poetry and thus belong to poetic vocabulary.
Behold! - Look!
Hark!- Listen!
Whilst - while.
     Historisms - are words which reflect some phenomena belonging to the past times:  knight (рыцарь),archer (лучник).
     Barbarisms or foreign words are comparatively new borrowings, which are new, fresh and not completely assimilated borrowings from other languages:  bon mot- clever saying.
   Literary coinages  may fall into following groups:
1 ) neologisms are words that have recently come into the language and are still felt as new: eg.  snowclone, xerox, googling, photoshopping;
2) terminological coinages designate newborn concepts;
3) stylistic coinages are words coined because their creators seek expressive utterance: eg.  anti-hero;
4)  nonce-words  are words coined to suit one particular occasion: eg. / am wived in Texas and 2 mother-in- lawed, uncled and aunted and cousined.
       With respect to the accepted literary norm of the language we distinguish Standard English and non - standard English which is represented by dialects and variants.
     Dialects are the non-standard varieties o f the language used on the territory o f the country. English dialects are divided into northern and southern dialects. Dialectal words are those which in the process o f integration o f the English national language remained beyond its literary boundaries and their use is generally confined to definite locality. They are to be found in the style o f emotive prose. The term  variants  refer to the use o f the language outside o f the country (The USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand).
    Special colloquial vocabulary includes: 
Slang  is everything below the standard language; it is a language peculiar to a particular group. It is the use o f informal words and expressions that are not considered standard in the speaker's language or dialect but are considered more acceptable when used socially. Slang is often to be found in areas o f the lexicon that refer to things considered taboo.
      It is often used to identify with one's peers and, although it may be com m on among young people, it is used by people of all ages and social groups. Slang refers to informal (and often transient) lexical items used by a specific social group, for instance teenagers, soldiers, prisoners and thieves: eg. props- respect, recognition (Gotta give that girl props for her web site...)off the hinges- similar to off the hook, something is outstanding, great" ("Yo, that concert was o ff the hinges!") warez -the de facto standard term for a piece of pirated software/music/movies copied from a friend or downloaded from the Internet. (This website has a huge abundance of warez on it!) dot gone -unsuccessful internet company).
      Jargonisms are words whose aim is to preserve secrecy within one or another social group. They need no explanation:
Grease- money
Loaf - head
Slang in contrary to jargon is obvious and needs no translation.
     Argot is a secret language used by various groups - including, but not limited to, thieves and other criminals - to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. 
The term argotis also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field o f study, hobby, job, sport, etc.
    Professionalisms are the words used in a definite trade, profession or calling by people connected by common interests both at work and at home: eg. in -fish – submarine (торпеда).
   Vulgarisms  are a group of words o f non - standard English. They are:
1) expletives or swear words which are o f an abusive character: eg.  damn, bloody.
2) obscene words
The function of these words is to express strong emotions like anger and vexation. They are to be found in the emotive prose style.
Colloquial coinages are spontaneous and elusive. They are based on a certain semantic changes in words: eg. You are the limit (in the sense of ‘‘to be unbearable  – ты не выносим).
